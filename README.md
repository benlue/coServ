## Why coServ
Providing smooth or excellent user experiences is becoming the norm of web applications. Even though it's trendy, it's definitely not a simple task. Compounded with the problems that today's web applications are much more complicated than they used to be, web developers need better web platforms to meet the challenge. Many platforms have been developed for the quest. Unfortunately, most platforms present more problems than solving them.

With the arrival of HTML5, CSS3 and ES5 (or the coming ES6), developers have enough power to tackle most web application problems. The issue is not to create a more powerful tool, but to effectively utilize those three fundamental technologies, let's call them F3 (HTML, CSS and Javascript). We've seen many web platforms invented new syntax or extensions on top of the standard, but do little to help developers make full use of F3. We're not happy with the direction to which many web platforms are heading, so we build coServ. Below are the major design guild lines for coServ:

+ With the help of coServ, developers can spend their time on designing and coding rather than spend time on learning or harnessing the platform itself.

+ Help developers not to repeat themselves.

+ Help developers to fully utilize HTML, CSS and Javascript to get their job done.

##  Features

+ Implemented in node.js.

+ Regardless it's backend functions or front-end templates, developers can use one single language (Javascript) to do them all.

+ Besides HTML, CSS and Javascript, developers don't have to learn anything new to use coServ.

+ Help developers to divide a page up to smaller regions and blocks, and to focus working on the parts.

+ An extremely easy and elegant way to provide multi-lingual support.

+ A single coServ server can host multiple websites, and it's very easy to manage them.

+ Support a very powerful CSS preprocessor called JASS.


## Current Version
The latest version of coServ is 0.9.2. Below is the release note of the latest release:

+ Supported server-side client detection telling requests are coming from what type of client devices (desktop, tablet or mobile).

+ Fixed bugs in "AddSite" and "AddPage" CLI when the web directory is not in the default location.
