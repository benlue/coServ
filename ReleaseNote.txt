0.8.6:
--------
 . Add command line interfaces (CLI) to (1) add a website and (2) add a new page to a website.
 . Release Date: 5/29/2014


0.8.5:
------
  . Change how a local module is invoked. The run() method now will take a second parameter which is
    a callback function. A local module calls the provided callback function to notify coServ that
    its job has done.
  . Bug fixes to help coServ better deal with more content types (not just JSON).
  . Fix a bug in uploader. The bug could cause coServ fail to upload files to the COIMOTION API engine.
  . A new demo is included in this release. The old demo is still around. If you want to run the old demo,
    try http://localhost:8080. You can also modify the www/sites.json file to bring back the old demo.


0.8.0:
------
The first public release.
